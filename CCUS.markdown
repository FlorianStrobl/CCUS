# CCUS language definition

## Version 1.0.0 (2021-2022)

CCUS stands for CC (me), universal and speed or simple.
The language was defined to be able problems with any abstraction of hardware and software while remaining simple and fast to developp in it.

The language is heavily inspired by the programming languages: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [C/C++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/csharp/) from their syntax and structures.

Example Code for a function `f(x) = 2x`:

```
func f(num x)
{
  ret 2 * x;
}
```

...

Any code none comform to the standart will have per definition undefined behaviour for implementations of this language.
